    <p>My name is Josh Barton and I love learning new technologies, understanding how they work, and using my creativity and critical thinking skills to incorporate them into products that make life easier.</p> 
    <p>I enjoy everything from front-end Web Development to understanding various data structures and algorithms to create a fast and reliable back-end.</p> 
    <p>When I'm not working on projects I enjoy watching sports, skiing, mountain biking, and spending quality time with my family.</p>
