    <h2>Web Chat Server</h2>
    <p>I created a basic WebChat server that allows users to communicate online. I created a back-end server that receives Web Socket requests, decodes them, and sends the response to the appropriate user. I created the front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to accommodate the user experience.</p>
