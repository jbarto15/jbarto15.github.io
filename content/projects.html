    <h2>Web Chat Server</h2>
    <p>I created a basic WebChat server that allows users to communicate online. I created a back-end server that receives Web Socket requests, decodes them, and sends the response to the appropriate user. I created the front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to accommodate the user experience.</p>

    <h2>DNS Server</h2>
    <p>I built a DNS server that receives DNS requests, parses the message information, and if the request is already contained in the program cache the appropriate message is sent back. If the request doesn't exist in the cache, the message is forwarded to Google and Google's response is sent to the client.</p>

    <h2>Unix Shell</h2>
    <p>I had the opportunity to build my own Unix Shell which developed my computer systems understanding of creating processes, switching between processes, and file descriptors. I enjoyed learning about the basic pieces of a shell program and implementing different features to my shell.</p>

    <h2>Not The Skiers</h2>
    <p>I love skiing and this project gave me the opportunity to create a game that incorporated skiing but most importantly helped enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.</p>
